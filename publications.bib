	abstract = {With the improvement of hardware and algorithms, the main challenge of software model checking has shifted from pure algorithmic performance toward supporting a wider set of input programs. Successful toolchains tackle the problem of parsing a wide range of inputs in an efficient way by reusing solutions from existing compiler technologies such as Eclipse CDT or LLVM. Our experience suggests that well-established techniques in compiler technology are not necessarily beneficial to model checkers and sometimes can even hurt their performance. In this paper, we review the tools mature enough to participate in the Software Verification Competition in terms of the employed analysis and frontend techniques. We find that successful tools do exhibit a bias toward certain combinations. We explore the theoretical reasons and suggest an adaptable approach for model checking frameworks. We validate our recommendations by implementing a new frontend for a model checking framework and show that it indeed benefits some of the algorithms.},

	abstract = {Formal verification is approaching a point where it will be reliably applicable to embedded software. Even though formal verification can efficiently analyze multi-threaded applications, multi-core processors are often considered too dangerous to use in critical systems, despite the many benefits they can offer. One reason is the advanced memory consistency model of such CPUs. Nowadays, most software verifiers assume strict sequential consistency, which is also the naïve view of programmers. Modern multi-core processors, however, rarely guarantee this assumption by default. In addition, complex processor architectures may easily contain design faults. Thanks to the recent advances in hardware verification, these faults are increasingly visible and can be detected even in existing processors, giving an opportunity to compensate for the problem in software. In this paper, we propose a generic approach to consider inconsistent behavior of the hardware in the analysis of software. Our approach is based on formal methods and can be used to detect the activation of existing hardware faults on the application level and facilitate their mitigation in software. The approach relies heavily on recent results of model checking and hardware verification and offers new, integrative research directions. We propose a partial solution based on existing model checking tools to demonstrate feasibility and evaluate their performance in this context.},

	abstract = {Communication models are a key aspect in the design and implementation of distributed system architectures. Application logic must consider the guarantees of these models, which fundamentally influence its correctness. Modern multi-core processor architectures face a similar problem when it comes to accessing shared memory: the guarantees of an architecture have a fundamental impact on the observable behavior of software. The formalization of these guarantees in a declarative way has led to powerful tools and algorithms to define reusable constraints on patterns of memory access events and their relationships, enabling the efficient description and automatic formal analysis of software properties with respect to a specific architecture. The Cat memory modeling language provides a standard means of specifying these constraints. Despite the parallels, the axiomatic modeling and analysis of communication models in distributed systems remain a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate how communication models can be mapped to the Cat language. We create a standard library of reusable patterns and demonstrate our approach, called NetworCat , on the simple examples of UDP and TCP, and we also present its applicability to the vastly configurable OMG-DDS service. This adaptation-based approach enables the use of ever-improving verification tools built for shared memory concurrency on distributed systems. We believe this not only benefits distributed system analyses by broadening the toolset for verification but also positively impacts the field of memory-model-aware verification by widening its audience to another domain.},

Most existing solvers use a diverse set of specialized techniques, including direct state space traversal or under-approximating abstraction, necessitating purpose-built complex algorithms. Other solvers successfully simplified the verification workflow by translating the problem to inputs for other verification tasks, leveraging the strengths of existing algorithms. One such approach transforms the CHC problem into a recursive program roughly emulating a top-down solver for the deduction task; and verifying the reachability of a safety violation specified as a control location. We propose an alternative bottom-up approach for linear CHCs, and evaluate the two options in the open-source model checking framework THETA on both synthetic and industrial examples. We find that there is a more than twofold increase in the number of solved tasks when the novel bottom-up approach is used in the verification workflow, in contrast with the top-down technique. © Márk Somorjai et al.},

Comparative evaluation as a competition, such as SV-COMP or CHC-COMP, sparks a more cohesive community around fields in formal methods. Lately, a trend has been emerging with tools such as Btor2C that bridge multiple fields together, thus widening this cohesion. Following that example, we propose and perform an experiment, where we use CHC-to-C transformation to apply software verification tools to linear CHC problems. In the process, we help both fields by diversifying the scene of CHC solvers and providing new and valuable benchmarks to aid the development of software verification tools. Using these benchmarks, we uncovered a previously hidden bug in multiple verification tools that can lead to false positive results. By analysing the results of the experiment, we can confidently make a recommendation for developers of software verifiers to consider supporting CHCs via our pre-verification transformation.},

Recently, preventative propagation rules have been introduced for consistency models to avoid unnecessary computations. This paper analyses the reproducibility of a recently published paper regarding a conflict-avoiding happens-before propagator. We show that the underlying axioms are insufficient for supporting sequential consistency. We find that the algorithm can leave out constraints on event ordering (even considering the original axioms), impacting the accuracy of verification. We show a simple counterexample to the stability claim in the paper. Two revisions of the algorithm are presented, and a proof on the correctness of these approaches respective of the original axioms is shown. The tool implementing the original algorithm is examined to ascertain how it circumvents wrong results. It is found that it deviates from the published algorithm. We show that an unmodified algorithm (via a patch in the implementing tool) causes incorrect results.

	abstract = {Abstraction-based software model checkers often rely on external analyses or unbounded SMT arrays to reason about pointers, arrays, and dynamic heap manipulation. External analyses are precise but often require the modification of existing verification algorithms, while SMT arrays provide a native solution for solver-based verifiers but require strict type safety often forgone in real-world programs. We propose a novel way of integrating a precise pointer and array analysis as a plug-in for abstraction-based model checking, which does not require the modification of the underlying algorithms. Our solution keeps track of arbitrary predicates over potentially abstract memory locations, moving toward more efficient verification of software code by allowing a fine-grained and precise abstraction of memory accesses.},

	abstract = {THETA is a verification framework that has participated in the CHC-COMP competition since 2023. While its core approach – based on transforming constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis – has remained mostly unchanged, THETA’s verification techniques, design trade-offs, and limitations have remained mostly unexplored in the context of CHCs. This paper fills that gap: we provide a detailed description of the algorithms employed by Theta, highlighting the unique features that distinguish it from other CHC solvers. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the tool in the context of CHC-COMP benchmarks. Notably, in the 2025 edition of the competition, Theta’s performance was impacted by a configuration issue, leading to suboptimal results. To provide a clearer picture of Theta’s actual capabilities, we re-execute the tool on the competition benchmarks under corrected settings and report on the resulting performance. © Bajczi et al.},

	abstract = {Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking, invariant synthesis, and inter procedural analysis. This paper introduces CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio. © Dobos-Kovács et al.},

Several algorithms exist for finding a partial order of instructions that is consistent with ordering constraints of the assumed memory model and that violates a safety property; or for proving that such partial orders do not exist. We present existing and novel bounded model checking approaches reasoning with happens-before relations of concurrent programs. These algorithms are implemented in THETA, a modular model checking framework. We also give a comparative evaluation of our THETA implementations and state-of-the-art verifiers.},

	abstract = {Calculating successor states in SMT-based software model checking is a costly task that often requires solving an SMT problem. However, in many cases, the evaluation of a program statement has no effect with respect to the verified property. Successor state calculation can be simplified in such cases. Several algorithms exist such as the cone-of-influence reduction that statically analyze the model and eliminate irrelevant variables from the model. In concurrent software, however, it is common for the result of a statement to be used in one interleaving of threads while unused in another. Algorithms that statically analyze the model cannot simplify such statements. Our on-the-fly approach detects whether a statement can be simplified during the state space exploration based on the current state of each process. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can simplify around 20% of all statements on average over a large set of benchmark programs while reducing the time of successor state calculation by more than 30% on average.},
